## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-28 — Phase 3: security and cloud identity

The posture a graded worker runs under, and the identity it is given. Six
subsystems under `src/security/`, all wired into `up`.

### Added
- **Egress (§5.9, §12.4)** — a deny-by-default allowlist whose matching is
  label-boundary correct: `*.googleapis.com` matches `storage.googleapis.com`
  and refuses both `evil-googleapis.com` and `googleapis.com.evil.test`. Hosts
  are normalized (case, trailing root dot, IDN → punycode, empty labels
  rejected) before comparison, because normalizing one side only is how a
  homoglyph of an allowed apex gets through.
- **Network lifecycle** — the worker network is created `--internal`, and `up`
  REFUSES to adopt a pre-existing network of that name that is not. A network
  wearing the configured name without `--internal` gives every worker
  unrestricted egress while the fleet reports deny-all, and nothing would say
  so.
- **Repository hazard scan (§12.2)** — a checked-out repo is INPUT, and several
  files in it are read by the agent as INSTRUCTIONS. The scan parses
  `.git/config` and `.git/config.worktree` as text (never `git config`, which
  would execute whatever `core.fsmonitor` names), covers every attributes
  source git honours, and records `detected` and `neutralized` as separate
  fields so "we saw it and left it" cannot read as "we defused it".
- **Cloud identity (§5.8, §12.4)** — per-worker credential planning, stated
  explicitly including when the grant is nothing. A refresh loop that schedules
  on the MONOTONIC clock, never from the issuer's `expires_at` label: this
  fleet runs on a laptop that sleeps, and a wall-clock comparison wakes to find
  every token simultaneously fresh or dead.
- **Control-socket auth (§12.7)** — a per-run 256-bit secret minted with
  `link(2)` so two racing minters cannot each serve their own, mode 0600, never
  mounted into a container. Every verb requires it, `ping` included.

### Fixed
- **`--no-ext-diff` alone did not close the diff-driver escape — it relocated
  it.** `.gitattributes` assigns `diff=name`; `[diff "name"]` may define
  `command` OR `textconv`, and `command` wins when both are present. So
  suppressing `command` made git fall back to *executing* `textconv`, on the
  host, outside the container. The middle state was strictly worse than no
  hardening, because a dormant driver became the live one.
- **The hazard scanner missed five `.git/config` forms git honours** —
  `[section] key = value` on one line (the header pattern was anchored and the
  key pattern demanded a line-initial key, so a line carrying both matched
  neither), CRLF endings (`.` excludes `\r`, so the value capture could not
  reach `$`), and a second `[header]` on the same line.
- **`up` quarantined the operator's own repository.** It scanned
  `config.run.repo` with the mutating entry point, renaming their real
  `AGENTS.md` aside and commenting out `filter.lfs.*` while leaving
  `filter.lfs.required = true` — which hard-fails every later `git add` on an
  LFS-tracked path. It also defended nothing, since workers read
  `<repo>/.worktrees/<id>`. Now detect-and-report only.
- **The harvester's environment crossed into git.** `runGit` spread
  `process.env` into a subprocess operating on a tree the graded worker
  controls, handing it cloud credentials and tokens; the sibling module built
  its env from a literal and the asymmetry was the bug.
- **A credential that shipped could be reported dead.** `onInjected` — the
  supervisor persisting a record — ran inside the try guarding mint/inject, so
  an ordinary `ENOSPC` there was reported as a failed refresh naming a
  generation never attempted.
- **The refresh loop ignored abort and pinned the process.** The signal was
  re-checked only after the sleep resolved (45 minutes at the default), and the
  timer was never `unref`'d, so the process outlived all of its work.

### Notes
- ISC-249 is OPEN, not met: neutralization belongs on the per-worker worktree
  at the moment it is created, and nothing creates one yet (ISC-27/28).
- ISC-248 and ISC-253 are OPEN: the refresher attaches to a running container
  and the headless path starts none; the egress relay does not exist, so
  containment is enforced by network isolation alone.
- ISC-254 is OPEN and unpinnable as written — `timingSafeEqual` and `===` are
  behaviourally identical, so only a timing measurement separates them.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-27 — Phase 2: artifacts and safety

A worker's self-report is now adjudicated against independent evidence, and a
run can be stopped before it spends everything.

### Added
- **Outbox contract (A1)** — `result.json` is untrusted input. It is
  schema-validated before any field is dereferenced; a path naming anything
  outside the mount table is refused *before* the path is opened; a symlink
  under `files/` pointing out of the outbox is refused via `lstat` + `realpath`
  rather than followed first; an oversized file is refused rather than buffered.
- **Repository harvest (A2)** — diff, commits and changed files from the
  worker's branch, gated on `git merge-base --is-ancestor <base> HEAD`. Without
  that gate a rewritten base still produces a plausible, much smaller diff
  through the surviving merge-base, and a worker that changed nothing looks
  clean.
- **Transcript harvest (A4) and usage (A6)** — reuses the existing `TailReader`.
  `U+2028` inside a JSON string survives (`readline` splits on it and silently
  drops the record); a 4-byte codepoint split across a poll boundary produces no
  `U+FFFD`; a session file rewritten in place is re-read from zero. Usage
  merges element-wise-max across sources, because an undercount feeding a token
  ceiling is a ceiling that never trips.
- **Acceptance runner** — commands are resolved from the **base SHA** and
  executed in a fresh clone outside the worker's worktree with no inherited
  environment. Independence is a property of *where the command is resolved
  from*, not of who runs it: the command string routes through `package.json`
  scripts, `conftest.py`, `.git/hooks` and the Makefile, every one of which is
  inside the worker's mutable surface.
- **Adjudicator** — the `failed < blocked < partial < success` lattice with
  `unknown` as the identity element, the harness-surface cap, discrepancy
  detection, and a hashed derived-fact bundle so an adjudication can be
  replayed. The hash covers the facts and not the verdict, so "same hash,
  different verdict" and "different hash" are distinguishable failures.
- **Budget ceilings** — on **tokens**, with an up-front reservation released on
  settle. Local models are unpriced, so a ceiling watching dollars never trips
  and is a comment rather than a control. The reservation doubles as the
  admission slot, which is also what distinguishes a *queued* worker from a
  *wedged* one — they look identical if you only watch event silence.
- **Kill ladder** — re-validates `(pid, started)` at every rung. A pid is not an
  identity: pids are reused, and a ladder escalating on an unvalidated pid
  eventually SIGKILLs a process that merely inherited the number.
- **Reaper** — staleness by monotonic change-detection, not by subtracting a
  wall-clock heartbeat label written by another process. Subtraction would
  mass-reap the whole fleet when a laptop resumes from sleep.
- **`src/util/clock.ts`** — the single home for monotonic time. The rule that no
  timing path may read `Date.now()` is now a test rather than a convention.

### Fixed
- A timed-out acceptance run adjudicated to `unknown`, and `unknown` being the
  lattice identity meant the worker's claim was adopted verbatim — so a task
  whose exam never finished was reported `success`. The route needed no harness
  edit: ship a change that makes an existing command hang, claim success,
  collect it. An attempted command that returns no answer now caps the verdict.
  It is still never `failed` — a timeout proves nothing about the code.
- Symlink containment canonicalizes its root. On macOS `/var` is a symlink to
  `/private/var`, so an uncanonicalized root made every legitimate in-outbox
  symlink compare as escaping.

### Notes
- The SRD's `CompactionEntry.retainedTail` does not exist in Pi 0.79.6; the
  installed session format spells the same concept as `summary` plus
  `firstKeptEntryId`. Implemented against the binary. Erratum in `ISA.md`.

### Security — found by adversarial review of this phase
- **`git diff` no longer executes what the graded repository tells it to.** A
  `.gitattributes` in the tree assigns a diff driver per path and
  `[diff "name"] command` in the repository's own config names a program git
  runs — on the host, as the harvester, outside the container the worker is
  confined to. Neutralized on the command line, because `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`
  and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` do not suppress `.git/config` and nothing in the
  environment can. `runGit` also no longer spreads `process.env`, which had
  been handing that subprocess the harvester's cloud credentials.
- **Outbox containment is checked at the roots.** `files/` was walked directly
  and so never met the per-entry symlink branch: a worker that replaced it
  with a link to `~/.ssh` had every key returned as a safe artifact with
  nothing refused. A symlinked task directory separately re-rooted containment
  onto the attacker's own directory, after which escaping links were approved.
  Accepted files are canonicalized and refused when their link count shows a
  second name elsewhere.
- **Envelope paths carrying control characters are refused.** A NUL is a single
  contained path as a JavaScript string and truncates to a different file at
  the C boundary; the same characters let a worker rewrite the harvest report
  that is judging it, since these paths reach an operator's terminal.
- **The harness surface covers what the test command resolves *through*.** The
  pattern list omitted `bunfig.toml` — the config for the runner this
  repository itself uses, whose `[test] preload` executes before any test — so
  a worker could turn a red suite green with the implementation still wrong and
  have nothing classified as harness. Runner config, inherited config
  (`tsconfig` `extends`, Makefile `include`) and toolchain selection are now
  included. A denylist cannot express this completely; the allowlist redesign
  is tracked as ISC-243.

### Fixed — found by mutation and adversarial review
- **One unharvestable task no longer destroys the run's harvest.**
  `readResultEnvelope` opened the file outside its own guard, so an envelope
  that `lstat`'d cleanly but could not be opened threw out of a function whose
  contract promises it never throws, propagated through an unguarded loop, and
  exited `artifacts` with code 2 and no JSON at all — losing every healthy
  task's harvest with the poisoned one.
- **The adjudicator is on the live path.** `artifacts` reached the two-argument
  lattice combinator, so the module implementing the evidence rules — the
  harness cap, the replay hash, the moved-tree void, the inconclusive-exam cap
  — had a full passing test suite and no production caller. This also settles a
  contradiction between two implementations of F5: SRD §880 makes
  *disagreement* between the envelope and the diff a hard failure class,
  unqualified, so concealment now fails as fabrication already did.
- **`facts_hash` is recorded, not just computed** — ISC-153 asks for hashed
  *and* recorded, and the hash was being dropped.
- **Flaky supervisor tests fixed at the root.** `socketPath` hashes
  `(run_id, worker_id)` into the shared `os.tmpdir()`, so tests using hardcoded
  run ids made concurrent test processes share a control socket and answer each
  other's RPCs. Six parallel lanes went from 5/6 failing to 6/6 green.

### Added — wiring completed after review
- **`artifacts --run-acceptance` holds the exam.** SRD §8.2 has the harvester
  re-run the acceptance commands *itself*; the runner existed, was unit-tested,
  and had no production caller, so `derived.acceptance` was always empty and a
  worker's self-report was the only thing grading it. Commands are resolved
  from the base SHA, not the worker's tree — independence is a property of
  where a command is resolved from, not of who runs it. Opt-in, because the
  default must stay a pure read: a read that silently clones a repository and
  executes code out of it is a different operation wearing the same name.
  Running in a fresh *container* rather than a fresh clone remains ISC-233.
- The daemon runs the reaper on an interval and deregisters what it reaps
  (ISC-236); the staleness threshold travels with the run in `run.json`, so the
  detached daemon judges by the interval the fleet was started under. This also
  makes `up --config` do something, which it previously accepted and ignored.
- `workerOutboxDir` has one definition (ISC-231). It was computed
  independently by the mount builder and the harvester, and a divergence there
  does not throw — harvest would find an empty directory and report a task that
  produced artifacts as having produced none.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-27 — Phase 1: container and headless core

`up → dispatch → wait → down` runs end to end on the `headless` backend against
the Pi double, and against real Pi 0.79.6.

### Added
- **Worker container** — `image build|list|verify|gc`. Read-only root, uid 10001,
  tini as PID 1, `gcloud`/`kubectl`/`helm`/`gsutil`/`bq` behind the `verbgate`
  PATH shim with a task-scoped allow list on a read-only mount.
- **Config** — `fleet.yaml` loader and validator with field-level errors, and
  `render --worker` to print the exact `docker run` and `pi` argv without
  executing either.
- **Detached supervisor** — its own session and process group, so it outlives the
  CLI that started it. One per worker.
- **Pi RPC client** — JSONL framing over stdin/stdout with a monotonic per-record
  stream sequence, split on `\n` only (never `readline`, which also splits on
  `U+2028`).
- **Completion detection** — `agent_end{willRetry:false}` plus a correlated
  double-read of `get_state`. There is no `agent_settled` message; the original
  design waited for one and would have hung on every task.
- **Epoch fencing** — every task attempt gets an epoch bound at the stream offset
  of its prompt ack, so a late event from a previous attempt cannot be
  misattributed to the current one.
- **Run state** — `state.json`, `fence.json`, `events.jsonl`, and a per-writer
  ledger, all written atomically.
- **CLI** — `doctor`, `up`, `daemon`, `status`, `dispatch`, `wait`, `abort`,
  `logs`, `exec`, `down`, on a strict exit-code ladder (2 usage, 3 backend, 4
  timeout, 5 budget, 6 worker died, 7 partial).
- **`pifleet-fake-pi`** — the scriptable test double the whole suite runs against.

### Fixed
- The epoch fence is recorded synchronously with the prompt ack. Resolving a
  promise only schedules a microtask, so a fence recorded after `await send(…)`
  landed *after* an `agent_start` that arrived in the same stdout chunk — the
  window never opened, every later event including `agent_end` was discarded, and
  the task hung forever.
- A deadline whose `abort` produces no terminal event now settles the task and
  kills the child, instead of leaving the worker `busy` indefinitely.
- `writeJsonAtomic` uses a unique temp name per call and cleans up on the throw
  path; concurrent writes to one path were producing unparseable files.
- `TailReader` detects file replacement by identity rather than size, so a
  rewritten session file is re-read from zero instead of resuming mid-record.
- Bind-mounted host paths are never derived from `os.tmpdir()`. On macOS the
  daemon runs in a VM that shares only a declared set of directories, and a `-v`
  against an unshared path mounts a silently *empty* directory with exit 0.
- Bind-mounted host directories are made accessible to uid 10001. A Linux bind
  mount passes host ownership through untouched, so `mkdtemp`'s 0700 and
  `mkdir`'s 0755 left the worker unable to write its own outbox — invisible on
  macOS, where the VM squashes ownership.
- `read_only` is enforced against the *effective* tool set. Omitting `tools`
  is not "no tools": Pi then grants every builtin, `bash` included, so the most
  natural way to write the role skipped the check entirely.
- verbgate's policy and ledger paths are constants rather than environment
  variables — the worker could previously hand the gate its own allow list and
  redirect its own audit trail.
- `dispatch` accepts the mandatory `epoch: 0` placeholder. The envelope schema
  requires the field and documents 0 as the placeholder, but dispatch treated any
  number as an explicit request, so every hand-written envelope was rejected
  `stale_epoch` for supplying the one value the schema forces its author to give.
- The container CI job tags the built image from the real `image list --json`
  shape. It read `d.images[0].tag` from what is a bare array, so the job had been
  red since it was added and no container probe had ever executed.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-26 — Phase 0: verify and scaffold

### Added
- Repository foundation: Bun/TypeScript skeleton, strict tsconfig, CI workflow,
  test pyramid layout.
- `Docs/SRD.md` — the pifleet system requirements document (v2.3), rewritten
  from live execution of the cmux and Pi surfaces. Eleven errors in the previous
  revision are recorded in its §18.
- `ISA.md` — the criteria that define done.
